                    <p>Well hello there, welcome to my webpage. I recently graduated from the University of Houston, receiving a bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Systems. With this degree I gained a generous amount of knowledge in technology, including software languages such as Java, FXML, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and Ruby on Rails. I also learn skills such as Learn Six Sigma, PMBOK / Project Management Body of Knowledge, and AWS Cloud Computing.  I have completed many software team projects that will be discussed below.  In June of 2020, I acquired the AWS Solution Architect Associate certification.  Please, explore the content below.</p>
